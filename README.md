# Apples Journey to Carbon Neutrality by 2030

## Challenge Objective

In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.

## About Data set

The dataset contains 3 tables, in CSV format. The "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" table contains the sources of Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022 divided by category (corporate & product life cycle), scope (direct scope 1 emissions & indirect scope 2 and 3 emissions), and type (emissions & removals). The "Carbon Footprint by Product" table contains the emissions from the product life cycle of every baseline iPhone model released between 2015-2022. The "Normalizing Factors" table contains Apple's revenue, market cap, and employees during the same period.

## Analysis and Findings

![Scope 1 Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/3f97e995-f8b7-41dc-a98c-ce11a636e4d5)

"Those greenhouse gas emissions caused directly by the company itself (e.g. by burning fossil fuels) are referred to as Scope 1." We can clearly see that line chart is showing the increase in Scope 1 emissions by year on year.

![Scope 2 Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/d5899dd9-f271-4c8b-9846-295cd42b19bb)

"The emissions caused indirectly by an organization, e.g. by purchasing secondary energy sources (e.g. electricity, heat, cooling or steam) and the associated emissions are called Scope 2." Line graph shows Scope 2 emission zero in 2019-2020 period but after this period again it has been increasing. it shows increase in use of secondary energy sources.

![Scope 3 Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/196c5264-e11f-43b1-a722-cd0f9b5d8161)


"Scope 3 emission sources include emissions from suppliers and product users. Transportation of goods, and other indirect emissions are also part of this scope." Line graph shows year by year decrease in scope 3.

![Carbon footprint by release year and product](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/ae87ac0c-14c2-4bce-9283-c22fe165a65a)

In this column chart, we can see initially product and year by year growth in Carbon Footprint but after 2019 can be seen a significant down trend in Carbon Footprint. In all this process Apple's most effective product so far has been the Iphone 6s and 2019-2023 time period has been the most important and most effective time period so far in terms of carbon footprint.

  ![Revenue and Employees by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/3678bb48-11a3-43ad-9f36-20f6edc7f269)

![Market cap by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/34ef171f-1519-43da-96a1-3db687f40890)

Above both Line graph shows the growth in Revenue and Market capitalization by year on year. In this report can be seen year on year decrease in emissions and carbon footprint and increase in revenue and market cap. it shows the strong business model of Apple company.

![Corporate Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/c5f60fbf-9e6c-4a12-9e7e-5e4fb28d72ae)

In above "Corporate Emission by fiscal year" Line graph can be seen continuosly down trend from 2019 in corporate emission but after 2021 it has started increasing.

![Product life cycle Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/57967ab9-68de-43ec-a264-e835a18e652d)

"Product life cycle Emission by Fiscal year" graph shows continuos improvement of company in decreasing emissions of product life cycle.

## Suggestions

- Company can reduce use of fossil fuels as much as possible.

- Company can Educate their employees, customers and partners on the importance of carbon neutrality.
