# Apples Journey to Carbon Neutrality by 2030

## Challenge Objective

In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.

## About Data set

The dataset contains 3 tables, in CSV format. The "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" table contains the sources of Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022 divided by category (corporate & product life cycle), scope (direct scope 1 emissions & indirect scope 2 and 3 emissions), and type (emissions & removals). The "Carbon Footprint by Product" table contains the emissions from the product life cycle of every baseline iPhone model released between 2015-2022. The "Normalizing Factors" table contains Apple's revenue, market cap, and employees during the same period.

## Analysis and Findings

![Scope 1 Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/3f97e995-f8b7-41dc-a98c-ce11a636e4d5)

"Those greenhouse gas emissions caused directly by the company itself (e.g. by burning fossil fuels) are referred to as Scope 1." We can clearly see that line chart is showing the increase in Scope 1 emissions by year on year.

![Scope 2 Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/d5899dd9-f271-4c8b-9846-295cd42b19bb)

"The emissions caused indirectly by an organization, e.g. by purchasing secondary energy sources (e.g. electricity, heat, cooling or steam) and the associated emissions are called Scope 2." Line graph shows Scope 2 emission zero in 2019-2020 period but after this period again it has been increasing. it shows increase in use of secondary energy sources.

![Scope 3 Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/196c5264-e11f-43b1-a722-cd0f9b5d8161)


- We can see down trend in Scope wise Emissions by Fiscal year. In Scope 2 Emission is 0. That is good sign toward achieving the goal.

![Carbon footprint by release year and product](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/ae87ac0c-14c2-4bce-9283-c22fe165a65a)

- We can evidently see the continuous down trend in carbon footprint by Release year and Product from 2019.
- Apple most effective product toward their goal to make "Product carbon neutral by 2030" is iPhone 6s.

  ![Revenue and Employees by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/3678bb48-11a3-43ad-9f36-20f6edc7f269)

![Market cap by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/34ef171f-1519-43da-96a1-3db687f40890)

- We can see Year wise Revenue and Market cap growth and it's a good sign for the company.

![Corporate Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/c5f60fbf-9e6c-4a12-9e7e-5e4fb28d72ae)

![Product life cycle Emission by fiscal year](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/57967ab9-68de-43ec-a264-e835a18e652d)

- We can see continuous downtrend in Year wise product life cycle Emission that will help company towards their goal.

## Suggestions

- Company can reduce use of fossil fuels as much as possible.

- Company can Educate their employees, customers and partners on the importance of carbon neutrality.
