# Apples Journey to Carbon Neutrality by 2030

## Challenge Objective

In 2020, after announcing their corporate operations were officially carbon neutral, Apple pledged to make their products carbon neutral by 2030. To achieve this goal, they set their emissions for 2015 (38.4 million metric tons CO2e) as the baseline and will aim to reduce them by 75% by 2030. The remaining 25% of gross emissions (9.6 million metric tons CO2e) will be removed using carbon offsets, bringing the net emissions to 0.

## About Data set

The dataset contains 3 tables, in CSV format. The "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" table contains the sources of Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022 divided by category (corporate & product life cycle), scope (direct scope 1 emissions & indirect scope 2 and 3 emissions), and type (emissions & removals). The "Carbon Footprint by Product" table contains the emissions from the product life cycle of every baseline iPhone model released between 2015-2022. The "Normalizing Factors" table contains Apple's revenue, market cap, and employees during the same period.

- We can see down trend in Scope wise Emissions by Fiscal year. In Scope 2 Emission is 0. That is good sign toward achieving the goal.

![Carbon footprint by release year and product](https://github.com/CodeofRahul/Apples_Journey_to_Carbon_Neutrality_by_2030/assets/143285125/ae87ac0c-14c2-4bce-9283-c22fe165a65a)

- We can evidently see the continuous down trend in carbon footprint by Release year and Product from 2019.
- Apple most effective product toward their goal to make "Product carbon neutral by 2030" is iPhone 6s.
